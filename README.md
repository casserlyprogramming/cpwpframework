CP Wordpress Framework
=============

This framework is under development constantly. Initially it will be used only
as a wordpress plugin. One that other Wordpress Plugins/Themes will require to 
be in place when we create them.

However, some of the functionality will be useful in everyday PHP scenarios. 

This code will be the culmination of all work on seperate projects and so therefore
should be easily pluggable.
